<p>
  This project is based on an A/B testing of an online marketplace called “GloBox”. More
  precisely, GloBox wants to perform an experiment to see if they should launch a banner
  highlighting food and drink category products at the top of their website. GloBox is primarily
  known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. In
  the case of A/B testing the customers are divided into two groups: The control group (Group A) who
  does not see the banner and the treatment group (Group B) who sees the banner.
</p>

<p>
  Based on the spending and non-spending behaviors of the customers, the dataset has been
  customized and at last two metrics have been identified for the purpose of this A/B testing. From
  those two metrics, the first one is categorized as “the difference in the conversion rate between two
  groups” where the conversion rate defines the rate of purchases in each group and the second
  one is categorized as “the difference in the average amount spent per user between two
  groups”.
</p>

<p>
  After performing some statistical operations (hypothesis test and confidence interval) on both
  metrics, it is found that one of the metrics is statistically significant and another one is
  statistically insignificant.
</p>

<p>
  Though only the first metric (the difference in conversion rate) is statistically significant, it is
  recommended to launch the banner for everyone who is browsing their website. This is
  because, a banner is not typically an expensive feature to launch, in terms of engineering time
  or operational overhead. So if either metric has a significant increase, that’s enough justification
  to go ahead and launch it.
